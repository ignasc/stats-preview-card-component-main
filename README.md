## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 and CSS
- Flex box
- Visual Studio Code software

### What I learned

Avoid filling the whole html with a lot of id's. That gets very messy very quickly. I will have to learn to group elements by their common purposes using classes.

### Continued development

Fitting items inside a flex container is still a bit of a struggle.
Centering elements horizontaly and especially vertically is a challenge in certain situations, when I want to keep certain minimum distance from the edge of a window and centered at the same time.

I am also having trouble centering elements vertically evenly. The desktop version of this page has a bigger top margin than the bottom one.
